# MoveSpooledFile explained

Users who have spooled DXReliablePersist folders on the LogRhythm Data Processor can use this to alleviate pressure on the server. 
The idea is that you have stopped the Mediator Service. Renamed the Spooling folder and restarted the Service.
This creates a new folder so the Data Processor can focus on LIVE ingestion.
The script can then be set up to drip feed the older logs into the Data Processor without overwhelming it.
The script prompts the user for the required folders so it can be applied to many use-cases e.g. unprocessed logs, DXRP, EventSpool
